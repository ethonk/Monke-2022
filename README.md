You are the zoo's night watchman, and the monkeys are getting a bit quirky...
## Monkeys inhabting the zoo
The monkeys living inside the zoo are beloved by many! You are tasked to keep them safe from themselves and you. They have their own little habits so be sure to balance them!
### George
George is the star of the show, he likes to roam but can be a little extreme when close to you so make sure you keep your door shut if he gets too close!
### Alfred
Alfred has a lot of fun at home in his inflatable pool. He frolics in the pool filled with bananas but he is a bit messy... Make sure to keep it topped up!
### Joey
Joey is a world renowned monkey chef, famous for his salads. Make sure to follow his every instruction and in a timely matter, or else he loses his temper!
### Showtime Monkey
This devious monkey doesn't show his face, but loves to display his ads. He blocks the way of your work so be sure to get rid of his ads.
### Johnathan
Johnathan is a tiny but sly monkey, loves his swing... loves vents even more! He's quite violent so make sure you keep your monkey mask on.
